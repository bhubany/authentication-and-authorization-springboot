/**
 * UserService is a Spring Service class that handles the business logic
 * related to user operations in the application. It provides methods for:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Creating a new user</li>
 * <li>Retrieving a list of users</li>
 * <li>Fetching details of a specific user by their ID</li>
 * <li>Updating an existing user by their ID</li>
 * <li>Deleting a user by their ID</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Each method returns a success message for demonstration purposes.
 * In a real-world application, these methods would typically interact with
 * a database or an external API to perform the necessary operations.
